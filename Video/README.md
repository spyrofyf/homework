## Guide
There are some video about my project. Before you look it, I want to state content of each video and tell you something.  
### display effect.mp4
This video shows the effect of my project. Everyone can watch this.
### ending 1-3.mp4
These videos contain the path to each ending and a lot of spoilers. I suggest you only watch it if your device can't run the game, if you're not going to try the game, and if you can't find a new ending. 
### the background music?
There is no sound in my whole project. All you hear is my computer fans, and keyboards and mouse clicks. However I thought the sounds fit the mood of my video so I kept them.
